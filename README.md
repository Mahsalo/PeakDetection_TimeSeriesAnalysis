# ECG Peak Detection Time Series Analysis
Detecting the QRS peaks in ECG time series

The ECG is a recording of the electrical conduction of the heart as seen from a specific view, which is determined by the placement of the recording electrodes. Under normal conditions, each heartbeat will produce three main ECG components: the P wave (atrial depolarization); the QRS complex (ventricular depolarization); and the T wave (ventricular repolarization). Identifying the location of these landmarks is fundamental to many interval and morphology-based analyses of the ECG (e.g. heart rate, heart rate variability, arrythmia detection, etc.). The presence of noise and arrythmia along with variable sensor configurations make this a challenging task for classical signal processing algorithms.
